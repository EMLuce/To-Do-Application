Hi Eric,

We hope all has been well since Will last spoke with you! We would like for you to complete this test project at your next convenience and if everything comes back well, from there we will move to an interview.

What we're looking for is a to-do app where a user can create and manage to-dos, being able to mark them as completed when finished.

Key Features:

User sign up/sign in / COMPLETED

Create, edit, and delete to-dos

Set due-dates for to-dos COMPLETED

Ability to order to-dos

Marking to-dos as complete COMPLETED

Attached is a very basic Flask application for you to use as a starting point:

flask_project_default.zip

We're just looking to get a better sense of how you work and build things. If you run into issues, feel free to reach out.

Here are some links for Flask, if you're not already familiar with it:

Flask Resources

We look forward to hearing from you. Please cc Will when you return the project and if you have any questions. As far as a timeline goes, we ask that you put your best foot forward but understand that the amount of time you take to return the project impacts our expectations.
